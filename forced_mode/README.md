## forced_mode
this folder contains:
- the CMakeLists.txt used to compile the executable with cmake
- forced_mode.c that is the executable

forced_mode.c is the modified example from the [BME API repo](https://github.com/boschsensortec/BME68x-Sensor-API/tree/master/examples/forced_mode) with a different initialization that doesn't use the BME AI studio piece of software.
